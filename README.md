### Reflections on Open Source in Today's World

  Josip Almasi's article "Why I Rewrote my Open Source Virtual Reality Server" dives into one of the major issues with modern VR development companies, as well as explains his solution. In a world where everything is always about money, he believes that issue has leaked into software design and in this particular situation the development of the VR industry. Comapnies wish to lock down developers faster and longer than their competitors so that they may win the ongoing race to distribute more product and make more money. In another unforunate series of events, we live in a world where data is a heavily mainlined product among an incredible amount of different industries, and this one is no different. Some VR headsets will track a ridiculous and unnecessary amount of your biometric data and immediately sell it off to any private organization. By creating his own open source VR server, Almasi has created a safe and private enrionment for his young children and family to all interact together and enjoy the outstanding modern technology the world has to offer, without worry that their privacy is being breached. 

  Meanwhile, Emily Shannon's [article](https://opensource.com/article/17/10/enable-update) highlights the Duke University eNable group which revolves around using open sourced software to assist in the creation of 3D-printed prosthetics for amputees. The article lists multiple modular devices which have been created and loaded with different open-sourced software to assist a wide range of people all over the world, including a young child in Milot, Haiti. To me it is so neat to see the type of open sourced programs that are available out there, whether it be to help a hand pinch or an arm move. In Chris's specific case, the young boy from Haiti, they utilized a design called the Gripper Thumb Hand. The fact that these types of software exist out in the internet for anyone to use is absolutely incredible and a wholesome and wonderful use of modern technologies. Using the software, the Duke eNable team was able to produce a 3D-printed plaster prototype and eventually come up with a final device that allows Chris to use his new arm with very few limitations. They were even able to provide him with spare parts. How neat is that!
